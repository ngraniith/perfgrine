• Full GUI-based interface for ease of use. <br>

• Improved visibility of throughput numbers.<br>

• Provides detailed logs and essential performance metrics.<br>

• Allows easy configuration of testing parameters such as test duration, server IP address, bandwidth allocation, protocol selection, and number of parallel streams.<br>

• Conducts network tests for 4G and 5G networks.<br>

• Generates traffic according to specified parameters and analyzes resulting throughput.<br>

• Presents essential performance metrics with bitrate prominently displayed for quick assessment of network speed.<br>

### Usage

• Launch the application.<br>

• You can either choose Server or Client according to your requirement.<br>

• If you choose server ,then your mobile acts as a server and you can start the test .<br>

• If you choose client , then your mobile acts as a client. Before starting your test , start iperf at your server side. <br>

• Use the intuitive GUI interface to configure testing parameters such as test duration, server IP address, bandwidth allocation, protocol selection, and number of parallel streams.<br>

• Start the test and monitor the progress.<br>

• Once the test is complete, review the detailed logs and essential performance metrics provided by the application on the summary screen.<br>

• Analyze the resulting throughput, with bitrate prominently displayed for quick assessment of network speed.<br>

### Configuration

Network Testing Tool allows easy configuration of various parameters to tailor tests according to specific requirements. These parameters include:

• Test duration <br>
• Server IP address <br>
• Bandwidth allocation <br>
• Protocol selection <br>
• Number of parallel streams <br>
